# The code used for the figures in my master's thesis
This repository contains the code used to generate the data and figures included in my master's thesis.
The scripts `calc_laad_karman.py`, `calc_laad_fda.py`, and `calc_laad_jhtdb.py` are used to compute the values for three indices (defined in the thesis):

- local sum of squared differences,
- local sum of inner products,
- locally-averaged angular deviation,

for three datasets:

- a K치rm치n vortex street,
- an [FDA nozzle benchmark](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13239-012-0087-5),
- a [forced isotropic turbulence dataset](https://doi.org/10.7281/T1KK98XB).

Once the the values for these indices have been computed, the figures may be generated by running `./thesis_plots.py`.

# Requirements
## Python dependencies
The required python libraries can be found in `requirements.txt`, which may be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Additionally, the [turbulence_statistics](https://github.com/thijs-blom/turbulence_statistics) library must be installed.

## External dependencies
The code in `thesis_plots.py` uses [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for typesetting.
To run this script, `pdflatex` must be installed (see for example [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/)).

## Data dependencies
To reproduce the figures accurately, the original datasets must be placed in the `data/` directory.
The datasets for the K치rm치n vortex street dataset can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10008534) and must be placed in the `data/karman/` directory.
Datasets for the FDA nozzle can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10008535) and must be placed in the `data/fda/` directory.
Data for the forced isotropic turbulence dataset from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence databases (JHTDB) can be obtained [here](https://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/) and must be placed in the `data/jhtdb/` directory.
